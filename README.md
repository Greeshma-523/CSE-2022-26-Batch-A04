Enhanced Verifiable Homomorphic Secret Sharing for Cloud Computing

This project implements a secure and privacy-preserving cloud storage system using homomorphic secret sharing and AES encryption. Encrypted files are split and stored across two independent cloud servers, allowing users to upload, view, and decrypt files securely. The system supports verifiable operations and privacy-preserving computations, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and transparency in distributed cloud environments.
